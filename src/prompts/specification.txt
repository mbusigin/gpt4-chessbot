The GPT-4 Chessbot application is a web-based chess game where users can play chess against an AI powered by GPT-4. The application's primary focus is to showcase GPT-4's strategic thinking ability in the game of chess, while also visualizing the chain-of-thought behind the AI's moves. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, while the frontend utilizes cm-chessboard for the chessboard display and TailwindCSS for styling and responsiveness.

Here's a detailed specification of the application's features and functionalities:

1. **Chessboard**: The application displays an interactive chessboard on which users can make moves and see the AI player's moves. 
   - The cm-chessboard library is used for rendering and interaction with the chessboard.
   - Moves are visually represented on the board, allowing users to follow the game progress.
   
2. **User side selection**: Users can choose to play as either white or black.
   - The selection is made before starting a game.
   - The AI automatically plays as the opposing side.

3. **AI difficulty**: Users can select the AI difficulty level, which impacts the AI's decision-making strength in the game.
   - Difficulty levels could include easy, medium, and hard.
   - The difficulty setting affects the API calls to GPT-4 and the parameters used in request (such as temperature).

4. **Turn-based gameplay**: Users and the AI player take turns moving their pieces according to standard chess rules.
   - Moves are validated using a chess library (e.g., chess.js).
   - Game rules like check, checkmate, stalemate, and draw are enforced using the chess library.

5. **GPT-4 AI integration**: GPT-4 is integrated to provide strategic move suggestions for the AI player.
   - API calls are made to GPT-4, sending the current chess position and receiving move suggestions along with the chain-of-thought.
  
6. **Chain-of-thought visualization**: Visualize and display GPT-4's chain-of-thought or reasoning behind its moves in real-time.
   - Updated after each AI move.
   - Presented as plain text, a list, or a visualized thought process tree.

7. **Responsive design**: The application's interface scales properly, providing a pleasant user experience on different devices and screen sizes.

8. **Game flow and interaction enhancements**: Provides additional features like a "New Game" button, turn indicator, and game status display.

9. **Promotions**: Handle pawn promotions for both user and AI player, allowing users to select promotion pieces when their pawn reaches the opposite end of the board. Similarly, handles AI pawn promotions.

By meeting these specifications, the GPT-4 Chessbot application aims to provide users with an engaging, challenging, and enjoyable chess gaming experience, while showcasing the strategic thinking capabilities of GPT-4 and allowing users to observe the AI's decision-making process.
